Amazon Alexa style GUI

Note: Microsoft speech to text keys will need to be updated in order for the program to work.

To ask a question, turn the  echo on by pressing the power button and then state a question.
To run a command on the echo, the inputted speech requires the word "Alexa".

Specific Commands are:
	- Alexa, Set a timer for "X" (Seconds/minutes/hours)
	- Alexa, Set a stopwatch
	- Alexa, What is the news

The use of the word Alexa is not needed when asking regular questions.

To turn off the timer or stopwatch, the user may either hit the action button on the top right of the device or say "Alexa, stop (timer/stopwatch)"
To mute the microphone, the user needs to press the mute button on the top left of the device.
	
Included is an executable jar file which will run our program on required systems.

This jar file is located within the root directory of the submission (alongside this README)

All the project source code is included within the Software-Engineering folder within the zip, it also contains the resources needed to run the program.

The test cases are also included, and can be found within the same folder under the test_files directory.

To run the jar file on a linux machine: 
1) Navigate to the directory it is saved in
2) java -jar Software-Engineering.jar
