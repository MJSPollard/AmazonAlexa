Team L's Submission for Sprint 3 of the Software Engineering Coursework.

To ask a question, turn the  echo on by pressing the power button and then stating a question.
To run a command on the echo, the inputted speech requires the word "Alexa".
Commands are:
	- Set a timer for "X" (Seconds/minutes/hours)
	- Set a stopwatch
	- What is the news

The use of the word Alexa is not needed when asking regular questions.

To turn off the timer or stopwatch, the user may either hit the action button on the top right of the device or say "Alexa, stop (timer/stopwatch)"
To mute the microphone, the user needs to press the mute button on the top left of the device.
	
We have included an executable jar file which will run our program on required systems.

This jar file is located within the root directory of the submission (alongside this README)

All the project source code is included within the Software-Engineering folder within the zip, it also contains the resources needed to run the program.

The test programs we have are also included, and can be found within the same folder under the test_files directory.

We have removed student numbers from our submissions for a flat mark across the team.

To run the jar file on a linux machine: 
1) Navigate to the directory it is saved in
2) java -jar Software-Engineering.jar
